Streets of Nam AKA Frogger



Your app must:

HAVE ITS OWN REPO, under your github account. NOT A FORK.
Include Wireframes and User Stories in the README
Wireframe: - Basically draw out what your game will look likeâ€”very different way it could look. You can use paper or any wireframe tool you find online.
User Stories - Wording should center around how a user interacts with your game, for example:
The user click starts and the level starts
When the user hits the f key a fire ball is catuplulated into the galaxy.
Render a game in the browser
Switch turns between two players, if your game doesn't make sense for two players talk to your local instructor about it
Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
Use JavaScript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it (we will show you how)
Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
Be reasonably complex
